* Clojure

Libraries --- I'm going to start with the basics.  Maybe flycheck support and clj-refactor later.  

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(straight-use-package 'cider)
(straight-use-package 'clojure-mode)
#+END_SRC


what the hell, let's get a linter in here too.  going to use clj-kondo because the cider people recommend it.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(straight-use-package 'flycheck-clj-kondo)
(require 'flycheck-clj-kondo)
#+END_SRC
