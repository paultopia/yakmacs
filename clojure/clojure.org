* Clojure

Libraries --- I'm going to start with the basics.  Maybe flycheck support and clj-refactor later.  

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(straight-use-package 'cider)
(straight-use-package 'clojure-mode)
#+END_SRC


what the hell, let's get a linter in here too.  going to use clj-kondo because the cider people recommend it.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(straight-use-package 'flycheck-clj-kondo)
(require 'flycheck-clj-kondo)
#+END_SRC

I think I will want to add CLJ-refactor in due course if only because of the [[https://github.com/clojure-emacs/clj-refactor.el/wiki/cljr-add-project-dependency][capacity to hot-swap libs]]

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp

(straight-use-package 'clj-refactor)
(require 'clj-refactor)

(defun activate-clj-refactor-h ()
    (clj-refactor-mode 1)
    (yas-minor-mode 1))

(add-hook 'clojure-mode-hook #'activate-clj-refactor-h)

#+END_SRC

apparently hot-swapping libs doesn't work.  I can get a dep into my project.clj with ~cljr-add-project-dependency~ but it won't load into repl until a lein deps run. sad.
