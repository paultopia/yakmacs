This is an incantation that appears to be required to get MELPA to work. I've got no idea why, but 
it comes from this place: 
https://francopasut.medium.com/emacs-melpa-and-the-failed-to-download-gnu-archive-error-b834bbe4491e

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(setq gnutls-algorithm-priority "NORMAL:-VERS-TLS1.3")
#+END_SRC

The rest of the setup for melpa, as copied from evil installation instructions 

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(require 'package)
(add-to-list 'package-archives
             '("melpa" . "https://melpa.org/packages/"))
(package-initialize)
(package-refresh-contents)
#+END_SRC

Download and install evil 

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(unless (package-installed-p 'evil)
  (package-install 'evil))
(require 'evil)
(evil-mode 1)
#+END_SRC
