# -*- in-config-file: t -*-

reminder to self: shift-TAB or g<tab> unfolds headings, for when you open this file and forget the keybinding.

* Wth?
This is the readme for the github repo where I attempt to make myself a functional emacs configuration from 
naked emacs. It's running on a raspberry pi, with the idea that after I make it sufficiently functional 
(which could be, like, years), then

This is also the configuration file itself, because I'm doing fancy org babel literate config stuff.

So, that's cool.


* Package management

** Make MELPA run

*** Cargo-Cult Incantation

This is an incantation that appears to be required to get MELPA to work. I've got no idea why, but 
it comes from this place: 
https://francopasut.medium.com/emacs-melpa-and-the-failed-to-download-gnu-archive-error-b834bbe4491e

May be platform specific, I should probably try getting rid of this when I move the whole config off 
the raspberry pi where I'm putting this together and onto the mac. (call that production rather than 
development.)

* Keybinding to make delimiter for elisp blocks with @ 

This is slightly black-magic-ey.  add-lisp-delimiters is defined in init.el. 
That function looks for a variable called in-config-file, and, if it's set 
(as it is on the very first line of this file... and apparently it has to be the very 
first line, the second line won't do), then it pastes in the BEGIN_SRC stuff. So I bind it to ampersand, 
because I don't *think* anything else uses @ ...?

This is something I may wish to remove in production too.


#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp

(add-hook 'org-mode-hook 
  (lambda () 
    (evil-global-set-key 'normal (kbd "@") 'add-lisp-delimiters)))

#+END_SRC


* Visual Fixes

This is going to have to be minimal in dev. I'm using it over terminal, so stuff doesn't work right. 
When I move to prod and GUI, will enhance.

** Theme

This could actually be a bit dicey. I'm working across blink in dark mode on my ipad and iterm with a semi-
light mode on my mac, and I've got no clue if emacs themes will look the same across these different 
terminals and on a GUI interaction. I guess I could VNC into an X session to test this out, but 
that seems like a hassle.  Yolo. 

The doom themes look nice. Ultimately, I want to set a light, low-contrast, theme for writing prose 
(i.e., in markdown mode), and a dark theme with higher contrast but a relatively limited spectrum for 
writing code. But let's start by seeing if I can get a light theme to even show up on my dark 
terminal on ipad.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(use-package doom-themes 
  :ensure t
  :config
    (load-theme 'doom-acario-light t)) 

#+END_SRC

Well, that's interesting. It seems to load the theme, but it doesn't get the background right. 
There's a light background, but it isn't blue like it is in the [[https://github.com/hlissner/emacs-doom-themes/tree/screenshots#doom-acario-light][screenshot]]. 

I wonder if it's blue in GUI.  Is there some kind of pair of flags, one that says light or dark, 
and works in terminal, and another that says a specific color and works only in GUI?  Well, 
at any rate, this is a lot nicer for now so I'll run with it, and maybe go see how it looks on my 
computer in a bit.

Well, even more oddly, the colors in iterm are a muted version of the colors on ipad.  That's a little wacky.  
It's not horrible, so, once again, I'm not going to bother to fix it. But, lordy. 

*** DONE fix parens highlighting in this theme.  It kind of sucks.

** I never even use the menu bar in GUI

kill it with fire.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(menu-bar-mode -1)
#+END_SRC


** Rainbow parens

Can't even begin to edit elisp without this, I want it in this mode noooow.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(use-package rainbow-delimiters)
(add-hook 'org-mode-hook #'rainbow-delimiters-mode)
(add-hook 'prog-mode-hook #'rainbow-delimiters-mode)
#+END_SRC


* Command browsing

Which-key is apparently The Thing 

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(use-package which-key)
(which-key-mode)
#+END_SRC

* TODO problems to fix
** TODO typing "emacs readme.org" on the command line opens in a scratch buffer, not the file.

it works when I use iterm over macos but not when I use blink over ios?!  WTF?? How is that even possible?

** DONE it dials out to MELPA on every start, even if there's no new packages to load.   

Maybe this has to do with package-refresh-contents? see: https://github.com/jwiegley/use-package/issues/494
The answer here https://stackoverflow.com/questions/24280325/emacs-use-package-and-package-refresh-contents 
might be the solution to sorting out when to call package-refresh-contents?

I'm starting by just commenting out the call to package-refresh-contents in the melpa setup. That works!  Yay! 

** DONE I don't seem to have a meta key on the ipad keyboard?
Something in here might be a fix. https://github.com/blinksh/blink/issues/198 

It appears that turning on the software keyboard on blink fixes that.  but...

** DONE I also don't have a meta key on the mac keyboard

possible fixes?  https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/MetaKeyProblems#toc1
I want the fn key to be meta on the mac.  I have other uses for option

For some bizarre reason, in iterm, the setting to remap an option key to meta at least isn't on the *keys* 
tab it's on the *profile* tab, then under the keys subtab there, way at the bottom.  Wow iterm. Wow. 

But maybe I can give it the right option key for meta now. 
Meh, doesn't seem to work.  Apparently "esc-plus" is the thing to set it to. But that breaks evil, because 
esc is how one gets to normal mode.  I guess I could figure out how to change that, and, dunno, 
give it to caps lock or something.

actually, the esc-plus setting seems to work on evil without breaking my normal escape.  I dunno how 
it manages to overload escape, but whev. 

** TODO some evil-org keybindings don't work.

e.g. [[https://github.com/Somelauw/evil-org-mode][supposedly]] t is bound to the todo cycling keyword thing (org-todo), but it... doesn't do jack?

* TODO enhancements to make
** Different cursor for normal vs insert or modeline or *something*
   Apparently this is a thing that doesn't work in terminal out of the box but does work in GUI. 
There is a [[https://github.com/7696122/evil-terminal-cursor-changer#change-log][package]] to force it. But it doesn't seem to work.  I at least want a damn modeline signal.

For modeline [[https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/Evil#toc19][here is some code worth trying]]. but [[https://github.com/emacs-evil/evil/issues/366#issuecomment-273751024][this code]] looks simpler.  I'll try the latter first.
(That works, but only colors the background of the single character. How to color the entire modeline, I wonder?)

I could also try [[https://github.com/seagle0128/doom-modeline][doom-modeline]]. 
** Stuff to steal from spacemacs
*** Leader key
**** command browsing from leader key
*** file browsing and completion in project

* TODO Checklist for moving to prod
** TODO Language support
   this is the list of languages that I must have functioning before I'm even going to consider moving off 
   spacemacs.  Not the nice-to-have languages.
   only languages with actual projects that I might want to edit in the near future (so no haskell, go, etc.)
   and leaving off languages with perfectly good alternative editors (swift, r)
*** TODO Markdown
Not technically mandatory since I have lots of alternative editors, but since part of the point of this project
is wanting to be able to use emacs for markdown and I hate spacemacs markdown layer, let's do it.
**** TODO spell check
*** TODO Python
**** TODO indentations handled sensibly
This means
- MANDATORY: being able to open a file created in another editor without shitting all over the intentation
- some kind of structural editing thing where I can paste a block in another block and have it be right?
- keybinding for [[https://emacs.stackexchange.com/questions/45774/confusion-about-space-and-tab-characters-in-emacs#:~:text=To%20make%20tabs%20and%20spaces,with%20both%20tabs%20and%20spaces][whitespace mode]] so at a minimum I can see and fix by hand indentation fuckups

*** TODO Vue.js
*** TODO Clojure
*** TODO shell scripts
*** TODO makefiles
*** TODO JSON
*** TODO YAML
** TODO completions for all programming languages
