Adding my markdown enhancements here, because there are getting to be a lot of them.  
Also, I might ultimately be able to just load this file in markdown mode, which could save some time.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp

(defun my-loading-file-test ()
(interactive)
(print "hello second org file!")
)

#+END_SRC
