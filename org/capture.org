* Org capture 


I think I'm going to try to make at least minimal use of org-capture. Doing it in a separate file because I expect to edit this a lot as I change projects.

[[http://www.howardism.org/Technical/Emacs/capturing-intro.html][good intro]]


#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (setq org-default-notes-file "~/Dropbox/org/inbox.org")
  ;; (setq org-capture-templates 
  ;;   '("t" "Unfiled Task"  entry
  ;;     (file org-default-notes-file)
  ;;       "* TODO %?" :empty-lines 1))

#+END_SRC



** Current projects

I'd really like to figure out how to git pull before running a template. 
I guess I could advise the function, but it would be a bit tough to figure out which buffer...?
So I expect merge conflicts here.  Hopefully it won't be too bad though.
