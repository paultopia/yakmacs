* Org capture 


I think I'm going to try to make at least minimal use of org-capture. Doing it in a separate file because I expect to edit this a lot as I change projects.



#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (setq org-default-notes-file "~/OneDrive - Northwestern University/tasks/task_inbox.org")
  (setq org-capture-templates 
    '(("t" "Unfiled Task"  entry
      (file org-default-notes-file)
	"* TODO %?" :empty-lines 1)))

#+END_SRC

Let's see if I can get org-agenda working too

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp

(setq org-agenda-files '("~/OneDrive - Northwestern University/tasks/task_inbox.org"))

#+END_SRC


** Current projects

I'd really like to figure out how to git pull before running a template. 
I guess I could advise the function, but it would be a bit tough to figure out which buffer...?
So I expect merge conflicts here.  Hopefully it won't be too bad though. 

Define projects all in one place I think. 

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (setq rolusa_tasks "~/OneDrive - Northwestern University/tasks/rolusa_tasks.org")
  (setq netlev_tasks "~/OneDrive - Northwestern University/tasks/netlev_tasks.org")
#+END_SRC


Rule of Law in US

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (add-to-list 'org-capture-templates
    '("r" "Rule of Law in USA Task"  entry
      (file rolusa_tasks)
	"* TODO %?" :empty-lines 1))

(add-to-list 'org-agenda-files rolusa_tasks 'append)

#+END_SRC

Networked Leviathan

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (add-to-list 'org-capture-templates
    '("n" "Networked Leviathan Task"  entry
      (file netlev_tasks)
	"* TODO %?" :empty-lines 1))
(add-to-list 'org-agenda-files netlev_tasks 'append)
#+END_SRC

this boilerplate really cries out for a macro.
