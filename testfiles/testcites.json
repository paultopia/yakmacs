  {"id":"bakerFugitiveSlaveClause2012","abstract":"Among the most long-lasting constitutional controversies in the antebellum era was the interpretation of the fugitive slave clause. It was the subject of repeated legislative and judicial construction at both the state and the federal level. It raised delicate questions about federalism and the balancing of property rights and personal liberty. Slaveholders and abolitionists brought irreconcilable constitutional positions to the table, ultimately dividing Northerners from Southerners. However, it was not just divergent political commitments that made it difficult to fix a stable meaning to the fugitive slave clause. The text itself was ambiguous enough to make it amenable to multiple interpretations. For precisely this reason, an examination of the changing interpretations of the fugitive slave clause uncovers antebellum constitutional praxis, allowing us to see how historical actors interpreted the Constitution and how those interpretations shifted over time.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,7,5]]},"author":[{"family":"Baker","given":"H.

  {"id":"cohenIllegalHowAmerica2020","abstract":"\"In Illegal, prominent political scientist Elizabeth Cohen explores the dark history of US immigration policy and proposes a major new plan for full-scale reform. As Cohen shows, the US has always maintained the right to exclude people from entry-from those deemed to have seditious intent to a broad category of \"undesirables,\" which has at times included epileptics, prostitutes, beggars, and anarchists. Cohen traces the particular invention of \"illegal\" immigration to 1882, when the Chinese Exclusion Act was enacted to suppress immigration by \"undesirable\" peoples of the world. Later, through the 1924 National Origins Quota Act, Congress massively expanded the scope of racial immigrant exclusions. However, as Cohen points out, the Registry Act of 1929 quietly provided a way for people who had come to the US without legal status to eventually become legal and to naturalize. In subsequent decades, Congress began to distinguish legal from illegal immigration by mapping out the first roads to citizenry. Yet when the registry system was eventually undone in 1986 with the introduction of selective \"amnesty\" for documented immigrants, the problem of \"the undocumented\" snowballed into a legal and economic disaster. Employers kept hiring undocumented workers, incentivizing immigration, but a lack of papers could place migrant families in legal limbo. Thus, by 1996, we had a citizenship crisis -- one exacerbated when terrorism became linked with unlawful immigration, manufactured by a Congress that had allowed its citizenship -- related functions to atrophy\"--","author":[{"family":"Cohen","given":"Elizabeth F."}],"call-number":"JV6483 .C54 2020","edition":"First edition","event-place":"New York","ISBN":"978-1-5416-9984-7","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020]]},"number-of-pages":"261","publisher":"Basic Books","publisher-place":"New York","source":"Library of Congress ISBN","title":"Illegal: how America's lawless immigration regime threatens us all","title-short":"Illegal","type":"book"},

  {"id":"fiorinaPoliticalPolarizationAmerican2008","abstract":"For more than two decades political scientists have discussed rising elite polarization in the United States, but the study of mass polarization did not receive comparable attention until fairly recently. This article surveys the literature on mass polarization. It begins with a discussion of the concept of polarization, then moves to a critical consideration of different kinds of evidence that have been used to study polarization, concluding that much of the evidence presents problems of inference that render conclusions problematic. The most direct evidence—citizens' positions on public policy issues—shows little or no indication of increased mass polarization over the past two to three decades. Party sorting—an increased correlation between policy views and partisan identification—clearly has occurred, although the extent has sometimes been exaggerated. Geographic polarization—the hypothesized tendency of like-minded people to cluster together—remains an open question. To date, there is no conclusive evidence that elite polarization has stimulated voters to polarize, on the one hand, or withdraw from politics, on the other.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,8,1]]},"author":[{"family":"Fiorina","given":"Morris P."},{"family":"Abrams","given":"Samuel J."}],"container-title":"Annual Review of Political Science","DOI":"10.1146/annurev.polisci.11.053106.153836","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2008]]},"note":"_eprint: https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev.polisci.11.053106.153836","page":"563-588","source":"Annual Reviews","title":"Political Polarization in the American Public","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev.polisci.11.053106.153836","volume":"11"},

However, this Essay argues that a more careful understanding of the contemporary dangers to the American rule of law are both broader-based and longer-term: inequality among the public, and epistemic polarization among the public as well as among legal elites (including constitutional law professors themselves), undermine the capacity of the American people to use the political tools available in our constitutional system to resist any power-grabbing executive, regardless of ideology. The rule of law conflicts of the Trump administration, while dangerous in their own right, are fundamentally symptoms of this broader political and legal crisis.","author":[{"family":"Gowder","given":"Paul"}],"container-title":"Cardozo Law Review de novo","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020]]},"page":"126-164","title":"The Dangers to the American Rule of Law Will Outlast the Next Election","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://cardozolawreview.com/the-dangers-to-the-american-rule-of-law-will-outlast-the-next-election/","volume":"2020"},

  {"id":"schneiderPolicePowerRace2008","abstract":"This article looks at riots that consumed Paris and much of France for three consecutive weeks in November 2005. The author argues that the uprisings were not instigated by radical Muslims, children of African polygamists, or despairing youth suffering from high unemployment. First and foremost, they were provoked by a terrible incident of police brutality, a tragedy among a litany of similar tragedies. Black and Arab youth were already frustrated: decades of violent enforcement of France’s categorical boundaries—both racial and geographic—had filled many with rage. When Minister of Interior Nicholas Sarkozy responded to the violent death of three teenage boys on October 25, 2005, by condemning the boys rather than the police officers who had killed them, he merely reaffirmed what many young blacks and Arabs already believed: that their lives have no value in France.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,8,2]]},"author":[{"family":"Schneider","given":"Cathy Lisa"}],"container-title":"Politics & Society","container-title-short":"Politics & Society","DOI":"10.1177/0032329208314802","ISSN":"0032-3292, 1552-7514","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2008,3]]},"language":"en","page":"133-159","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Police Power and Race Riots in Paris","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0032329208314802","volume":"36"},
